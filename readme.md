**elf02 WP Responsive Images - WordPress Plugin**

Responsive image solution using picturefilljs. Base idea from [timevko.com][2].

This version makes no use of any shortcode. It expands each posted image with a data-responsive attribute. A "the_content" filter replaced such a image with the picturefill.js markup. After deactivating of the plugin, all images should appear as normal.

You can replace the standard image sizes and breakpoints in top of the elf02-wp-responsive-images.php file. I'm too lazy to make a settings page ;).

Picturefill.js from [Scott Jehl][1]. Sligtly modified by me :).
