# elf02 WP Responsive Images - WordPress Plugin

**New version with picturefill.js v2**

Responsive image solution using picturefill.js by [Scott Jehl][1]. Original idea by [Tim Evko][2].

This version comes without Shortcodes. It extends each posted image with a data-responsive attribute. A "the_content" filter replaced such an image with the picturefill.js markup. After deactivating the plugin or removing the data-responsive attribute, all images should appear as normal.

**You can replace the standard image sizes and breakpoints in top of the *elf02-wp-responsive-images.php* file. I'm too lazy to make a settings page ;).**
